Developed a Convolutional Autoencoder using TensorFlow and Keras to denoise facial images from the FER2013 dataset. Preprocessed grayscale images, added Gaussian noise, and trained a deep learning model with Conv2D and UpSampling layers. Evaluated performance through visual comparisons and loss metrics, demonstrating effective noise removal.
